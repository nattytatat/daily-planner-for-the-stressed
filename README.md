# Daily Planner for the Stressed

## Description

- A simple JQuery and Javascript app, allowing the user to input events onto a daily planner, saving their events to the local storage

- Using JQuery methods, Javascript, HTML, Bootstrap and the moment.js library to enable time functionality.

- The moment library helps identify the day and time, loading the working hours of the day - in this case 9am to 5pm. 

- Depending on the time of day, the past, present and future timeblocks are colour coded for easy recognition.

- Each hour of the working day is a textarea that the user can input and save to the local storage. A note pops up when an event is saved.

- Upon page reload the data remains on the page. Only a new date clears the current data from the browser.
